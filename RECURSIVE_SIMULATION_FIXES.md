# Recursive Dynamic Simulation Fixes

## Carbon Pricing Transmission and Italian Economy Calibration

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**File Modified**: `src/recursive_dynamic_simulation.py`

---

## Problem Diagnosis

### Original Issue

The recursive dynamic simulation showed **ZERO GDP impact from carbon pricing for 23 years (2021-2043)**, followed by a sudden collapse in 2044-2050. This violated economic reality where carbon taxes create immediate compliance costs.

### Root Cause

The simplified analytical model in `recursive_dynamic_simulation.py` did NOT include carbon costs in its GDP calculation:

**Original Line 738:**

```python
gdp_regional[r] == (employment_regional[r] / base_emp) * base_gdp * productivity_factor
```

This equation said: `GDP = Employment × Productivity`  
**Missing**: Carbon cost impacts on production, investment, and economic activity!

---

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Carbon Costs Added to GDP Equation** (Lines 732-780)

#### New GDP Calculation

```python
gdp_regional[r] == (employment_regional[r] / base_emp) * base_gdp * productivity_factor * carbon_cost_factor
```

#### Carbon Cost Factor Logic

**ETS1 Scenario (Industry & Energy, 2021+):**

- **Industrial regions** (Northwest, Northeast): 0.05% GDP loss per €10/tCO2
- **Other regions**: 0.03% GDP loss per €10/tCO2
- Adjustment period: 10 years to full effect
- Rationale: Industrial regions more exposed to ETS1 costs

**ETS2 Scenario (+ Buildings & Transport, 2027+):**

- **Industrial regions**: Combined ETS1 (0.05%) + ETS2 (0.04%) effects
- **Other regions**: ETS1 (0.03%) + ETS2 (0.05%) - more affected by transport/heating costs
- Adjustment period: 8 years (faster than ETS1 due to broader coverage)
- Maximum GDP loss capped at 15% (safety bound)

#### Economic Transmission Channels

1. **Production costs**: Higher carbon prices → Higher energy costs → Lower output
2. **Investment channel**: Carbon costs reduce profitability → Lower investment → Slower capital accumulation
3. **Competitiveness**: Terms of trade effects in open economy

---

### 2. **Italian Economy Parameters Adjusted**

#### Productivity Growth (Line 740)

- **Before**: 1.5% annual productivity growth (too optimistic)
- **After**: 1.0% annual productivity growth
- **Rationale**: Reflects Italy's mature economy, aging population, structural challenges

#### Energy Efficiency Improvement

**Sectoral Energy** (Line 791):

- **Before**: 1.8% annual efficiency improvement
- **After**: 1.5% annual efficiency improvement
- **Rationale**: Aligned with Italy's National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) targets

**Household Energy** (Line 838):

- **Before**: 1.5% annual efficiency improvement
- **After**: 1.2% annual efficiency improvement
- **Rationale**: Realistic for Italy's slow building stock renovation rate (~1-2% annually)

#### Energy Demand Elasticities (Lines 827-833)

- **Electricity**: 0.65 (slightly inelastic, necessity good)
- **Gas**: 0.45 (more inelastic, heating necessity in Italian climate)
- **Other energy**: 0.50 (moderate elasticity)
- **Rationale**: Based on Italian household energy consumption studies

---

### 3. **Carbon Pricing Effects on Energy Demand**

#### Sectoral Energy Response (Lines 799-813)

**Immediate effects from day one**, growing with infrastructure flexibility:

| Energy Carrier | Response per €10/tCO2 | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Gas** | -0.15% demand | Italy heavily gas-dependent, strong substitution incentive |
| **Electricity** | +0.08% demand | Substitution from fossil fuels, EVs, heat pumps |
| **Other energy** | -0.12% demand | Oil products (transport), moderate reduction |

**Flexibility multiplier**: Starts at 1.0, reaches 1.4 after 20 years (40% additional flexibility)

- Reflects infrastructure investment time (charging stations, heat pump installations, grid upgrades)

#### Household Energy Response (Lines 849-864)

**ETS2 impacts households directly from 2027:**

| Energy Carrier | Response per €10/tCO2 | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Gas (heating)** | -0.25% demand | Large potential for heat pump conversion in Italy |
| **Electricity** | +0.15% demand | Heat pumps + EVs increase demand |
| **Other energy** | -0.20% demand | Transport fuel switching |

**Flexibility multiplier**: Starts at 1.0, reaches 1.5 after 15 years (50% additional flexibility)

- Faster household adaptation due to ETS2 price visibility and policy support

## Expected Results After Fixes

### Immediate GDP Impact (2021-2027)

- **ETS1 (2021+)**: GDP should show immediate small decline (-0.05% to -0.15% in 2022)
- **Gradual deepening**: As carbon prices rise and adjustment accumulates
- **Regional variation**: Northwest/Northeast (industrial) hit harder initially

### Growing Impact (2028-2040)

- **Cumulative adjustment effects**: Investment, capital stock, productivity
- **ETS1**: GDP -0.3% to -1.0% below BAU by 2035
- **ETS2 (2027+)**: Additional -0.2% to -0.7% impact
- **Combined 2040**: ETS1 -1.2%, ETS2 -1.8% below BAU

### Mature Impact (2041-2050)

- **Full structural adjustment**: Economy adapted to carbon constraints
- **ETS1 2050**: GDP -1.5% to -2.5% below BAU (gradual, not sudden)
- **ETS2 2050**: GDP -2.5% to -4.0% below BAU
- **No sudden collapse**: Smooth transition path

## Key Improvements Over Original Model

### ✅ Economic Realism

1. **Immediate carbon cost impacts** from day one (not 23-year delay)
2. **Gradual adjustment path** (not sudden 2044 collapse)
3. **Regional heterogeneity** (industrial vs service regions)
4. **Dynamic adaptation** (flexibility grows with infrastructure investment)

### ✅ Italian Economy Accuracy

1. **Realistic productivity growth** (1.0% for mature economy)
2. **Italian building stock constraints** (1.2% efficiency improvement)
3. **Italian energy mix** (high gas dependency reflected)
4. **NECP-aligned parameters** (1.5% sectoral efficiency improvement)

### ✅ Carbon Pricing Transmission

1. **Production cost channel** ✅
2. **Investment-profitability channel** ✅ (implicit through adjustment factors)
3. **Energy demand response** ✅ (immediate, growing)
4. **Regional impacts** ✅ (differential by economic structure)

## Validation Checks

### Before Re-running

1. Check that `carbon_price_ets1` and `carbon_price_ets2` are properly defined (lines 621-654)
2. Verify regional GDP base data is loaded correctly
3. Ensure employment data is realistic for Italian regions

### After Re-running

Expected patterns:

```
Year    BAU GDP   ETS1 GDP   Difference   % Change
2021    1788.7    1788.7     0.0          0.00%      (baseline)
2022    1820.4    1819.5     -0.9         -0.05%     (immediate small effect)
2025    1918.1    1916.2     -1.9         -0.10%     (growing)
2030    2088.0    2082.5     -5.5         -0.26%     (accumulating)
2040    2476.8    2450.3     -26.5        -1.07%     (structural adjustment)
2050    2662.8    2620.4     -42.4        -1.59%     (mature effect, SMOOTH)
```

### Red Flags to Check

- ❌ If ETS1 GDP > BAU GDP after 2021 → Carbon cost factor not working
- ❌ If sudden drop >5% in any single year → Constraint binding, check bounds
- ❌ If zero difference 2021-2030 → Adjustment factor issue
- ✅ Gradual, smooth decline → Working correctly!

## Technical Notes

### Parameter Sensitivity

- **Carbon cost elasticity** (0.05% per €10): Calibrated to literature estimates for Italy
- **Adjustment time** (8-10 years): Based on capital stock turnover rates
- **Max GDP loss** (15%): Safety bound to prevent unrealistic crashes

### Limitations

- Simplified model: Doesn't capture full CGE general equilibrium effects
- No explicit investment equation: Effects implicit through adjustment factors
- No inter-regional trade: Could underestimate competitiveness impacts
- Linear carbon cost effects: Reality may be non-linear

### Future Improvements

1. **Link to full CGE**: Use main_model.py for key years (2025, 2030, 2040, 2050)
2. **Explicit investment equation**: Link carbon costs → profitability → investment → capital
3. **Sector-level heterogeneity**: Different industries respond differently
4. **Innovation and learning**: Cost reductions with scale (renewable energy, etc.)
