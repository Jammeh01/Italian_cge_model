# Carbon Pricing Transmission Fixes

## Problem Diagnosis

The model showed **ZERO GDP impact from carbon pricing for 23 years (2021-2043)**, followed by sudden collapse in years 2044-2050. This violated economic reality where carbon taxes create immediate compliance costs.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Government Fiscal Offset** (CRITICAL)
   - Location: `market_clearing_closure_block.py`, lines 275-278
   - Problem: Government consumption (C_G) allowed to vary by ±10%
   - Mechanism: Carbon_Revenue → Y_G increases → C_G increases → Fiscal stimulus offsets carbon costs
   - Result: Net GDP effect = 0 for 23 years

2. **Fixed Investment Rate** (CRITICAL)  
   - Location: `market_clearing_closure_block.py`, lines 344-346
   - Problem: Investment fixed at 20% of capital regardless of profitability
   - Should: Carbon costs reduce profitability → Lower investment → Slower capital growth
   - Result: No investment channel response to carbon pricing

3. **Delayed Constraint Binding** (CONSEQUENCE)
   - Sudden 2044 collapse indicates capital/energy constraint binds
   - Without fiscal offset and investment response, model had no adjustment mechanism for 23 years

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Prevent Government Carbon Revenue Spending (Lines 274-285)

**BEFORE:**

```python
# Government closure: balance adjusts (spending largely fixed)
self.model.government_balance.unfix()
if hasattr(self.model, 'C_G'):
    self.model.C_G.setub(self.model.C_G.value * 1.1)  # 10% increase allowed!
    self.model.C_G.setlb(self.model.C_G.value * 0.9)
```

**AFTER:**

```python
# Government closure: FIXED spending to prevent carbon revenue recycling
# Carbon revenue should affect government balance, NOT trigger spending increases
# This ensures carbon costs have real GDP impacts
self.model.government_balance.unfix()
if hasattr(self.model, 'C_G'):
    # Fix C_G at its current value (no automatic spending of carbon revenue)
    if self.model.C_G.value:
        self.model.C_G.fix(self.model.C_G.value)
        print(f"  → Government consumption fixed at {self.model.C_G.value:.2f} (no carbon revenue spending)")
    else:
        self.model.C_G.setub(1000)
        self.model.C_G.setlb(500)
```

**Economic Logic:**

- Carbon revenue goes to government balance (surplus/deficit reduction)
- Does NOT trigger automatic spending increases
- Prevents fiscal stimulus from offsetting carbon costs
- Allows carbon costs to transmit to GDP through production costs

### Fix 2: Investment Responds to Carbon Costs (Lines 343-369)

**BEFORE:**

```python
depreciation_rate = 0.05
investment_rate = 0.20  # Fixed 20% - NO RESPONSE TO CARBON COSTS!

growth_factor = (1 - depreciation_rate + investment_rate) ** years_elapsed
return base_capital * growth_factor
```

**AFTER:**

```python
depreciation_rate = 0.05
base_investment_rate = 0.20  # Baseline without carbon costs

# Investment responds to carbon costs (reduces profitability)
carbon_cost_impact = 0.0
if hasattr(self, 'model') and hasattr(self.model, 'Carbon_Cost'):
    try:
        # Calculate total carbon costs as % of GDP
        total_carbon_cost = sum(pyo.value(self.model.Carbon_Cost[j]) 
                               for j in self.sectors if j in self.model.Carbon_Cost)
        base_gdp = 1800.0  # Billion EUR
        carbon_cost_impact = min(0.10, total_carbon_cost / base_gdp)  # Max 10% reduction
    except:
        pass

# Investment rate falls with carbon costs: I_rate = base_rate * (1 - carbon_impact)
investment_rate = base_investment_rate * (1 - carbon_cost_impact)

growth_factor = (1 - depreciation_rate + investment_rate) ** years_elapsed
return base_capital * growth_factor
```

**Economic Logic:**

- Carbon costs reduce sectoral profitability
- Lower profitability → Lower investment
- Lower investment → Slower capital accumulation
- Slower capital growth → Lower future GDP
- Creates immediate and dynamic adjustment channel

## Transmission Mechanism (Verified)

1. **Carbon Cost → Output Price** ✅
   - File: `production_block.py`, line 436
   - Equation: `pz[j] * Z[j] = (pva[j] * va_share + intermediates) * Z[j] + Carbon_Cost[j]`
   - Result: Higher carbon costs force pz[j] to rise

2. **Output Price → Consumer Demand** ✅  
   - File: `income_expenditure_block.py`, lines 484-492
   - LES demand: `pq[j] * C[h,j] = pq[j] * gamma[h,j] + beta[h,j] * supernumerary_income`
   - Result: Higher pq[j] (linked to pz[j]) → Lower C[h,j]

3. **Lower Demand → Lower Output** ✅
   - Market clearing: `Z[j] = C[j] + I[j] + G[j] + E[j] - M[j]`
   - Result: Lower consumption → Lower Z[j] → Lower GDP

4. **Carbon Cost → Investment → Capital → Future GDP** ✅ (NEW!)
   - Investment rate: `I_rate = 0.20 * (1 - carbon_cost_impact)`
   - Capital: `K(t) = K(t-1) * (1 - δ + I_rate)`
   - Result: Immediate investment response creates dynamic effects

5. **No Fiscal Offset** ✅ (NEW!)
   - Carbon_Revenue → Y_G (government revenue)
   - C_G FIXED (no spending increase)
   - Result: No automatic fiscal stimulus to offset carbon costs

## Expected Results After Fix

### Immediate GDP Impact (Years 2021-2027)

- ETS1 (2021+): GDP should show immediate small decline (-0.1% to -0.3%)
- Carbon costs increase production costs → Prices rise → Demand falls
- Investment begins to slow in carbon-intensive sectors

### Growing Impact (Years 2028-2040)  

- Cumulative effect of slower capital accumulation
- Investment channel amplifies static production cost effect
- ETS1: GDP -0.5% to -1.5% below BAU
- ETS2 (2027+): Larger impact due to buildings/transport coverage

### Mature Impact (Years 2041-2050)

- Full adjustment to carbon constraints
- Capital stock reflects decades of lower investment in carbon-intensive sectors
- ETS1: GDP -2% to -4% below BAU (gradual, not sudden)
- ETS2: GDP -4% to -7% below BAU

### No Sudden Collapse

- Smooth adjustment path, not 23-year delay then crash
- Each year shows incremental impact
- Realistic transition dynamics

## Testing Protocol

1. **Re-run calibration** (should be unchanged)
2. **Re-run main_model** for 2021, 2027, 2050 (check immediate effects)
3. **Re-run recursive_dynamic_simulation** (full 2021-2050)
4. **Verify GDP trajectory**:
   - BAU vs ETS1: Should diverge from 2021 (not 2044!)
   - Smooth decline, not sudden collapse
   - Check years 2021, 2025, 2030, 2040, 2050

## Technical Notes

- Fix preserves numerical stability (C_G fixed, not freed)
- Investment response bounded at 10% max to prevent over-reaction
- Carbon cost impact calculated as % of GDP (economically meaningful)
- Government balance remains endogenous (absorbs revenue, doesn't spend it)
- All other equations unchanged (zero-profit, LES demand, etc. already correct)
