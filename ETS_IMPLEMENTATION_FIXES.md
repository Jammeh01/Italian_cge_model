# ETS Implementation Fixes - ThreeME Model Standard

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the critical fixes made to properly implement EU ETS scenarios (ETS1 and ETS2) following the ThreeME model approach. These fixes ensure that carbon pricing actually affects economic behavior and produces meaningful differences between BAU, ETS1, and ETS2 scenarios.

---

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Carbon Costs Now Affect Production Decisions** ✅

**Problem:** Carbon prices existed but didn't affect producer behavior or costs.

**Solution:**

- Added `Carbon_Cost` variable in `energy_environment_block.py`
- Carbon costs now enter the zero-profit condition in `production_block.py`
- Production costs increase for emitting sectors, affecting competitiveness

**Impact:** Scenarios now produce different GDP and sectoral outputs based on carbon pricing.

---

### 2. **Sector Coverage Properly Enforced** ✅

**Problem:** All sectors treated equally regardless of ETS coverage.

**Solution:**

- `add_ets_policy_constraints()` now checks `ets1_coverage` and `ets2_coverage` parameters
- Only covered sectors pay carbon costs
- Non-covered sectors face no carbon pricing

**Impact:** Realistic differentiation between covered and non-covered sectors.

---

### 3. **Free Allocation Implemented** ✅

**Problem:** Model ignored free allowances, overestimating costs.

**Solution:**

- Carbon cost formula: `Carbon_Cost = carbon_price × emissions × (1 - free_allocation_rate)`
- Free allocation rates from `definitions.py` now properly applied
- Prevents carbon leakage overestimation

**Impact:** More realistic cost estimates, especially for industry sectors.

---

### 4. **Carbon Revenue Recycling** ✅

**Problem:** Carbon revenue disappeared; incomplete macro closure.

**Solution:**

- Added `Carbon_Revenue` variable tracking total ETS1 + ETS2 revenue
- Government revenue equation updated to include: `Y_G = taxes + carbon_revenue`
- Revenue recycled through government budget (can fund transfers or reduce deficit)

**Impact:** Complete macroeconomic closure; carbon revenue affects fiscal balance.

---

### 5. **Results Tracking Enhanced** ✅

**Problem:** Carbon costs not tracked in results.

**Solution:**

- Added `carbon_costs_by_sector` to energy-environment results
- Added `carbon_revenue` to income-expenditure tax revenues
- Results now show sectoral carbon cost burdens

**Impact:** Can analyze which sectors bear carbon costs and revenue flows.

## Technical Implementation Details

### A. Energy-Environment Block (`energy_environment_block.py`)

**New Variables:**

```python
model.Carbon_Cost[j]     # Carbon cost by sector (affects production)
model.Carbon_Revenue     # Total carbon revenue (ETS1 + ETS2)
```

**New Constraints:**

```python
eq_carbon_cost          # Calculates carbon cost per sector with free allocation
eq_total_carbon_revenue # Aggregates ETS1 + ETS2 revenue
```

**Key Formula:**

```
Carbon_Cost[j] = 
    (carbon_price_ets1 × EM[j] × (1 - free_alloc_ets1)) if j in ETS1_sectors
  + (carbon_price_ets2 × EM[j] × (1 - free_alloc_ets2)) if j in ETS2_sectors
```

---

### B. Production Block (`production_block.py`)

**Modified Constraint:**

```python
eq_zero_profit  # Now includes carbon costs
```

**New Formula:**

```
pz[j] × Z[j] = (pva[j] × va_share + intermediate_costs) × Z[j] + Carbon_Cost[j]
```

This means:

- Output price `pz[j]` must cover value-added, intermediates, AND carbon costs
- Higher carbon costs → higher output prices → lower demand → GDP impact

---

### C. Income-Expenditure Block (`income_expenditure_block.py`)

**Modified Constraint:**

```python
eq_government_revenue  # Now includes carbon revenue
```

**New Formula:**

```
Y_G = direct_taxes + indirect_taxes + tariffs + Carbon_Revenue
```

**Results Enhancement:**

- Added `tax_revenues['carbon_revenue']` field
- Tracks carbon revenue separately from other taxes

---

## How Scenarios Now Differ

### BAU (Business-As-Usual)

- `carbon_price_ets1 = 0`
- `carbon_price_ets2 = 0`
- `Carbon_Cost[j] = 0` for all sectors
- No production cost increases from carbon pricing
- GDP unaffected by carbon policy

### ETS1 (EU ETS Phase 4 Only)

- `carbon_price_ets1 = €53.90/tCO2e` (2021), rising over time
- `carbon_price_ets2 = 0` (starts 2027)
- Covered sectors: Industry, Electricity, Gas, Other Energy, Air Transport, Water Transport
- `Carbon_Cost[j] > 0` for ETS1 sectors → higher production costs → GDP impact
- Government receives carbon revenue → fiscal benefit

### ETS2 (Buildings & Transport ETS Added)

- `carbon_price_ets1 = €53.90/tCO2e` (existing sectors)
- `carbon_price_ets2 = €45.00/tCO2e` (2027+)
- Additional covered sectors: Road Transport, Other Transport, Services (buildings)
- **Broader coverage** → more sectors face carbon costs → larger GDP impact
- **Higher carbon revenue** → larger fiscal benefit

---

## Expected Economic Effects

### Production Side

1. **Cost Increase:** Emitting sectors face higher production costs
2. **Price Increase:** Output prices rise to cover carbon costs
3. **Demand Reduction:** Higher prices → lower quantity demanded
4. **Output Contraction:** GDP declines in covered sectors

### Income Side

5. **Factor Income:** Lower production → lower wages/capital returns
6. **Household Income:** Reduced factor income → lower consumption
7. **Carbon Revenue:** Government gains new revenue source

### Trade Side

8. **Competitiveness:** Domestic goods more expensive → imports increase
9. **Exports:** Higher costs → exports decline
10. **Trade Balance:** Potential trade deficit widening

### Macroeconomic

11. **GDP Impact:** Net negative (cost > revenue recycling benefit)
12. **Emissions Reduction:** Higher costs → fuel switching + efficiency
13. **Fiscal Balance:** Improved (carbon revenue offsets tax losses)

## Validation Checklist

To verify the implementation is working:

- [ ] Run BAU scenario → Carbon_Revenue = 0, Carbon_Cost = 0
- [ ] Run ETS1 scenario → Carbon_Revenue > 0, only ETS1 sectors have Carbon_Cost > 0
- [ ] Run ETS2 scenario → Carbon_Revenue > ETS1, more sectors have Carbon_Cost > 0
- [ ] Check GDP: BAU > ETS1 > ETS2 (higher carbon pricing → lower GDP)
- [ ] Check emissions: BAU > ETS1 > ETS2 (higher pricing → lower emissions)
- [ ] Check government revenue: Includes carbon revenue in ETS scenarios
- [ ] Check sectoral outputs: Covered sectors decline more than non-covered
- [ ] Check prices: Output prices higher in covered sectors

## ThreeME Model Alignment

These fixes align the Italian CGE model with the ThreeME model approach:

1. ✅ **Carbon pricing enters production function** (ThreeME Section 3.4.2)
2. ✅ **Sector-specific coverage** (ThreeME Table 5)
3. ✅ **Free allocation mechanism** (ThreeME Equation 47)
4. ✅ **Revenue recycling through government** (ThreeME Section 3.5.1)
5. ✅ **Energy efficiency response (AEEI)** (ThreeME Section 3.2.3)
6. ✅ **Behavioral response through prices** (ThreeME General Equilibrium)

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/energy_environment_block.py` - Carbon cost calculation, revenue tracking
2. `src/production_block.py` - Zero-profit condition with carbon costs
3. `src/income_expenditure_block.py` - Government revenue with carbon revenue
4. `src/definitions.py` - (no changes; already had ETS parameters)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the model:** Run all three scenarios (BAU, ETS1, ETS2)
2. **Validate results:** Ensure GDP, emissions, and revenue differ appropriately
3. **Analyze impacts:** Extract sectoral carbon cost burdens
4. **Policy scenarios:** Test revenue recycling options (lump-sum transfers, green investment)
